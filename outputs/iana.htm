I encountered an error while trying to use the tool. This was the error: 404 Client Error: Not Found for url: https://www.iana.org/domanins.
 Tool fetch_html accepts these inputs: Tool Name: fetch_html
Tool Arguments: {'url': {'description': 'URL completa (http/https) a recuperar.', 'type': 'str'}}
Tool Description: Descarga el HTML bruto de una URL. Devuelve el HTML como texto..
Moving on then. I MUST either use a tool (use one at time) OR give my best final answer not both at the same time. When responding, I must use the following format:

```
Thought: you should always think about what to do
Action: the action to take, should be one of [fetch_html, fetch_rendered_html]
Action Input: the input to the action, dictionary enclosed in curly braces
Observation: the result of the action
```
This Thought/Action/Action Input/Result can repeat N times. Once I know the final answer, I must return the following format:

```
Thought: I now can give a great answer
Final Answer: Your final answer must be the great and the most complete as possible, it must be outcome described

```
